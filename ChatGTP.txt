These are the requests to ChatGPT which helped to build this application:

Generate Java REST service with Spring Data for Employee. Employee should have name, department, email, manager (also employee). Use lombok. Implement service level, use MapStruct for conversions.

add PATCH endpoint to EmployeeController

add validation for Employee: name and email shouldn't be empty

what should I change in pom? (Incomplete)

how to generate error response if validation is failed? (Exclude)

how to generate error response if InvalidInputException is thrown? (Exclude)

how to do it with @ControllerAdvice? (Correct now)

generate Open API documentation for the service (Good)

swagger url "http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html" doesn't work with this configuration (wrong answer)

	Was need to use Google: “springfox 3 swagger url”
	Found this thread on GitHub: Springfox swagger-ui.html not loading using version 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT (first result)

	Actual answer was found here:
	https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/3362#issuecomment-953568248
	To support 3.0, we should add springfox-boot-starter dependency and use another URL:
	http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/

	Otherwise we can downgrade to Swagger 2.x.x

Generate unit test for EmployeeController

what import should be used for is() static method?

Header "location" is null in post and patch responses. How to fix it?

Generate cucumber test to check this REST service endpoints (only .feature generated)

Generate Java code with steps implementation. Use OpenFeign. (Steps are incomplete)

continue (not continuing, tells how to use Feign - and do it wrong, but generates correct @FeignClient)

show EmployeeSteps code (again unfinished)

continue (shows complete EmployeeSteps code)

show Gherkin steps (show new updated Gherkin steps - but it’s cutted)

show complete feature file with steps (show updated Gherkin steps - now it is complete)
